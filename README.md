# Automate your job search

1. make a free crunchbase pro account (remember to deactivate it after you're done or else they'll charge you after a week)
2. get list of companies and emails from crunchbase that match your filter and save it in google sheets. the script will require changes if you copy paste in a different way:
   [copypaste.mov](media/copypaste.mov)
3. download excel sheet as jobs.xlsx
4. run the code in the notebook and if all goes well then you'll get a csv file x.csv with company,email
5. go to hunter.io and run an email campaign with this list.
